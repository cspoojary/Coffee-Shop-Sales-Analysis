# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis
## Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project Using  MS Excel

I developed a comprehensive project in Excel creating multiple dashboard and tables to analyse the data this process involved several stages including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

### Dataset used
- <a href = "https://github.com/cspoojary/Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Coffee%20Shop%20Sales.xlsx">Dataset</a>

### The Situation
It was an coffee chain with three locations in new York city.

### The Assignment
- To better understand purchase behaviour and streamline operations, I've collected transactional data from jan-jun 2023.
- Now my goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that coffee shop owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

### The Objectives
1. Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis.
   - Familiarize the data.
   - Adding new column to calculate **Revenue = (Price*quantity)**
   - Adding new column to calculate **Month** and **Day Of Week** based on transaction date.(displaying as text)
   - Adding new column to extract **Hour** from the transaction time.
2. Explore the data with Excel Pivot Tables.
   - Inserting a Pivot Table on a new tab to show revenue by month.
   - Add three additional PivotTables:
     A.display the **Number of Transactions** by **Day of the Week** and by **Hour of the Day**, sorted in descending order by transactions.
     B.To show the **Number of Transactions** by **Product Category**, also sorted in descending order.
     C.To present both the **Number of Transactions** and **Revenue** by **Product Type**, sorted in descending order and filtered to display the Top 15.
   
   
4. Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends.
