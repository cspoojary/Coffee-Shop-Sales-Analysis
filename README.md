### The Situation
It was an coffee chain with three locations in new York city.

### The Assignment

- Now my goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that coffee shop owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

### The Objectives
1. Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis.
2. Explore the data with Excel Pivot Tables
3. Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends.
