## Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project Using  MS Excel

I developed a comprehensive project in Excel creating multiple dashboard and tables to analyse the data this process involved several stages including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

- <a href = "https://github.com/cspoojary/Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Coffee%20Shop%20Sales.xlsx">Dataset</a>

### The Situation
It was an coffee chain with three locations in new York city.

### The Assignment
- To better understand purchase behaviour and streamline operations, I've collected transactional data from jan-jun 2023.
- Now my goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that coffee shop owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

### The Objectives
1. Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis.
   - Familiarize the data.
   - Adding new column to calculate Revenue = (Price*quantity)
   - Adding new column to calculate Month and Day Of Week based on transaction date.(displaying as text)
   - Adding new column to extract Hour from the transaction time.
2. Explore the data with Excel Pivot Tables.
   
4. Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends.
