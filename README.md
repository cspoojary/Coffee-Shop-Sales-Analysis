# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis
## Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Project Using  MS Excel

I developed a comprehensive project in Excel creating multiple dashboard and tables to analyse the data this process involved several stages including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

### Dataset used
- <a href = "https://github.com/cspoojary/Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Coffee%20Shop%20Sales.xlsx">Dataset</a>

### The Situation
It was an coffee chain with three locations in new York city.

### The Assignment
- To better understand purchase behaviour and streamline operations, I've collected transactional data from jan-jun 2023.
- Now my goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that coffee shop owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

### The Objectives
1. Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis.
   - Familiarize the data.
   - Adding new column to calculate **Revenue = (Price*quantity)**
   - Adding new column to calculate **Month** and **Day Of Week** based on transaction date.(displaying as text)
   - Adding new column to extract **Hour** from the transaction time.
     
2. Explore the data with Excel Pivot Tables.
   - Inserting a Pivot Table on a new tab to show revenue by month.
   - Add three additional PivotTables:<br>
     A. Display the **Number of Transactions** by **Day of the Week** and by **Hour of the Day**, sorted in descending order by transactions.<br>
     B. To show the **Number of Transactions** by **Product Category**, also sorted in descending order.<br>
     C. To present both the **Number of Transactions** and **Revenue** by **Product Type**, sorted in descending order and filtered to display the Top 15.

- Dashboard Interaction <a href = "https://github.com/cspoojary/Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Coffee%20Shop%20Sales.xlsx">View Dashboard</a>

   
3. Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends.
   - Adding Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a **Line charts**, transaction by day of week and hour of the day as **Column charts**, and transactions by product category as a **Bar charts**.
   - Assembling the charts into rough dashboard layout, and include space for the Pivot table showing Top 15 product types.
   - Adding slicer to store location, and connect it to all of the Pivot tables on the sheet.
   - Adjust formatting alignment and polish to finalize the dashboar.

## Project Insights
- ðŸ”¹ High Sales Spike: Significant sales activity observed between 7 AM to 10 AM, especially on weekdays.
- ðŸ”¹ Peak Day: Monday sees the highest sales volume compared to other days.
- ðŸ”¹ Evening Drop: Very low sales during 7 PM to 8 PM, indicating minimal customer engagement at that time.
- ðŸ”¹ Top Products: Tea and coffee are the most sold products, especially during morning hours.
- ðŸ”¹ Operational Mismatch: Shop remains open past 6 PM despite poor evening performance, potentially leading to unnecessary operational costs.
- ðŸ”¹ Market Opportunity: Other shops stay open after 6 PM, but customer demand for this shop drops sharplyâ€”signaling a need to re-evaluate business hours.
- ðŸ”¹ Potential Strategy Shift: Adjusting operating hours and pricing strategy by time slot could increase margins and reduce losses.
